<p>I've started this journal primarily to document my journey into data science. I've essentially been a Product Manager since 2012 and I've been looking for something in tech that would pique my interest sufficiently where I'd be willing to devote more time.</p>

<p>Understanding what's behind the data and predicting what comes next is more interesting to me than the infrastructure side of it. This is not to say that the infrastructure isn't important. It is. Understanding what lays beneath the data is my way of finding that inner motivation to embark on this journey.

<p>Naturally my skills are rusty but getting started with setting up Github Pages has been a nice intro achieving some small wins. This post by John McGlone has been more helpful than Github's documentation on setting up Github Pages: <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</a></p>
